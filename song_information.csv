Catfish and the bottlemen,Cocoon,"“Cocoon” is about a guy who falls in love with a “good girl” – everyone else thinks she’s too good for him, and the song details how they slowly become more alike. It appears onCatfish and the Bottlemen’s debut albumThe Balcony.In an interview withNME, frontman Van Mccann describes the writing process as beginning during his life if New York when he was 21:It was just this kind of tune about like, fuck what anybody else wants for you or thinks you should do, life is whatever you want, there is no right or wrong way of doing it. So be whoever you want to be and let your mates be whoever they want to be, and don’t worry about it. It’s just a tune about looking that way, and anyone else that’s looking that way, fuck them."

Catfish and the bottlemen,Kathleen,"The most popular single from Welsh rock bandCatfish and the Bottlemen’s debut albumThe Balcony. Lead singer Van McCann described the meaning behind “Kathleen”in an interview with Steve Lamacqas:It’s about being infatuated with somebody but in a bad way. You know, the person you call when you’re tanked up and you know it’s over and you know you don’t get on…and you’re always fighting, but something keeps bringing you back no matter how much it drives you crazy.McCann also stated in the band’s session forGigwise:It’s about that girl in everyone’s life who cuts your clothes up and makes headbands out of them, then wears them with her new boyfriend."

Catfish and the bottlemen,Tyrants,"Tyrants was actually the first song ever made by Catfish, Van wrote it when he was 14 and they have ended every single live show they have ever done with this song.They’ve gone from jamming at their mates' parties at 16 to selling out on headline tours."
Deftones,7 words,"7 Wordsis the first single of Deftones' first studio album,Adrenaline.It is one of the few songs of that era that are still played at Deftones' shows. It is a common set-closer.The song title refers to the police statement, “You have the right to remain silent.”In an interview, frontmanChino Morenogoes into detail:I wrote it back when I was 16 years old. It’s probably one of the angriest songs I’ve ever written. It was about being oppressed by people around me, the authorities, I felt like the whole world was against me. It was like I was lashing out at those people.""A common meaning of the song is about police lashing out against minorities only due to their style or skin color, when they have done nothing wrong at all."
Deftones,Cherry waves,"4th song of the album Saturday Night Wrist.Singer Chino Moreno has stated this song is about testing the trust a person has in someone else.Cherry Waves is somewhat of a metaphor for blood in an ocean. Chino repeatedly drops subtle mentions of death throughout the song. On the other hand, the Cherry also symbolizes warmth and tenderness and love. He juxtaposes love and death throughout the song in the form of these “Cherry Waves”."
Deftones,Digital bath,"Upon first listen, “Digital Bath” is a hauntingly beautiful song that could be played during a late-night cruise.One critic says:“Digital Bath”, “Knife Prty”, and “Change” are all defined by the ghostly samples in the background that perfectly match Chino’s vocals and the wonderful harmonic phrasing on those songs.Diving farther into the song, however, we learn that it is about luring a girl into a bathtub, killing her with an electrical device, and then dressing her back up.Chino Moreno, lead vocalist of Deftones, on “Digital Bath”:The song itself, if you took the lyrics out of it and you listen to just the melodies and the song, you wouldn’t think that it would be a violent song. It’s a prettier, spacier song.A separate quote from Chino from the same source:It was probably 5 in the morning – we were still up partying – and I just pictured this whole scenario of having this girl, bringing her downstairs and taking a bath and like, out of nowhere, just reaching back and electrocuting – basically throwing some kind of electrical device in the bathtub and then taking her out of the bath and drying her off and putting her clothes back on."
Deftones,Knife prty,"Knife Prtyis the seventh track of Deftones' third studio album,White Pony. The song features vocals from female singerRodleen GetsicThe opening chords forKnife Prtylead into a distorted introduction with a moving bass line and a vocal bridge sung by Getsic in Spanish-Arabic stylesays onecritic.Chino Moreno, the frontman of Deftones, had this to say:It’s a seductive song with a lot of violent imagery. People don’t tend to like sex mixed with violence. The mid section has amazing vocals from a girl called Rodleen who worked next door to our studioThe inspiration for this song was a strange party on the band’s tour bus once, where a everyone had a knife from Abe’s knife collection and was dancing around the bus with them. Chino then created an imaginary scenario from it about a secret knife society.I made up this fake scenario of some kind of underworld society of knives, people who just get off on these erotic fantasies…or something like that. An ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ kind of thingChino says.Symbolically speaking, it is an intimate story where a man (in this case, Chino) and a woman build their attraction. They either get high off of each other’s aurora, or with the use of drugs.They both climax (potentially in different ways), and Chino is left wanting more."
Deftones,Mascara,"Mascarais written about Chino’s then-wife, Celeste. He describes in aninterviewthat his former wife hardly listened to his music. He describes a time when she listened in the car with him. After it finished, she had no reaction, which frustrated him tremendously."
Deftones,Passenger,"The ninth song from the group’s third albumWhite Pony, this slow-burning ballad is rife with metaphorical imagery and atmospheric musical arrangements.While Chino Moreno’s symbolic lyrics are always freely up for interpretation, there are three common meanings:1.) It is simply about sexual activity in a moving car.2.) He is symbolically talking about willingly putting your life into someone else’s hands, and just being along for the ride.3.) This quote directly from Chino:I did this song with Maynard from Tool. Basically, I told him I wanted to create a scenario of being in a car and being taken for a drive when you don’t really know what’s going on. I wanted him to create a lot of imagery. He wrote a majority of the lyrics and left blanks for me to fill in. It seems like you’re being held captive, but enjoy what’s going on.Passenger is notable for featuring guest vocals byMaynard James Keenan, the front-man ofTool,A Perfect Circle,Puscifer, amongotherthings.On April 7, 2016, Deftones'record labelreleasedThe Studio Album Collection, which is an official remaster of every studio album -not includingB-Sides and Rarities,Covers, andGore.On some songs, there are new elements to be heard that are nonexistent on the original version. In the original mastering stage, there may be some parts the band and producer were wanting to leave out or forgot to put in.After the final line of the song, there is anadditional vocal addedfrom Chino. He has done this live in older shows, but it was not audible in the original record."
Deftones,Sextape,"Frontman Chino Moreno discussed this lament about spiritual isolation with Artist Direct. Said Moreno: “I love that one; it jumps around a lot. I was going to fix it so every verse told one cohesive story, but I decided that I really like it the way it is. It’s really fragmented. Pieces of information are in different places—under the water and in the city. It’s broad, and it feels really good. It adapts to the overall vibe. It has a night time feel to it as well. We’ve been playing it in rehearsal and I realized how much I like it now. When I first wrote it, I thought, ‘You could tell this is one of my songs. It’s probably the most Team Sleep-esque song on the record.’ I didn’t want it to be too self-indulgent right off the bat or for people to think, ‘This is Chino just being Chino.’ Really it’s not; everybody contributes on that song fairly equally. I wrote the opening riff, but the song grew from everybody building on to that. It’s more of a Deftones song than people might believe it is. Playing the song in rehearsal, it sounds mighty. For the simple fact that it doesn’t have any crush guitar, screaming or anything aggressive on it, ‘Sextape’ sounds really big.”"
Fiona apple,Criminal,"“Criminal”is the fourth track onFiona Apple’s debut album,Tidal. It was released as the third single in September 1997 and is her biggest hit. The song won theGrammy Awardfor “Best Female Rock Vocal Performance” at the 40th Grammy Awards and was also nominated for “Best Rock Song”.Apple describes the song as “a description of feeling bad for getting something so easily by using your sexuality.” About the writing, Fiona toldPitchfork:One of my friends said to me, “Oh yeah, of course you aren’t writing.” So I was like, “The next time you see me, I’m gonna have a new song.” I wrote “Criminal” in 45 minutes when everyone else went to lunch because I had to have a hit. I can force myself to do the work, but only if someone is right up behind me.Themusic videowas directed by Mark Romanek and it spurred quite a controversy as it shows an emaciated Fiona Apple, surrounded by what appears to be tranquilized models, undresses as she croons lyrics like “I’ve been a bad, bad girl.” Her appearance, as described by theNew Yorkeras being similar to that of an “underfed Calvin Klein model”, spurred accusations that the video promoted “heroin chic” and had “overtones of child porn.”Fiona was unhappy about the video, saying,during a 1999Washington Postinterview: “I thought that it was cheesy. I didn’t look like myself. It’s kind of ruined the song for me.”She eventually made a statement about trying to look like someone you’re not as she accepted herMTV Video Music Awardfor “Best New Artist” later that year, specifically “go with yourself.”"
Fiona apple,Every single night,"“Every Single Night” is the lead single of Fiona Apple’s albumThe Idler Wheel…; it was the first new music she released after seven years of absence from the music scene.Here, Apple illustrates a complex relationship with “big feelings.” During these sleepless nights, she takes on this fiery range of emotions. Eventually, Apple learns that, while she holds an indispensable fire within her, she is not a beast. Feelings are precious, and transient!The music video was directed by Joseph Cahill in Paris, France."
Fiona apple,Fetch the bolt cutters,"“Fetch the Bolt Cutters” is the title track to Fiona’s fifth album, released April 17th, 2020. It was inspired by a scene inThe Fall, where Gillian Anderson’s character says “fetch the bolt cutters” to the police in order to release a girl who has been tortured.Much like the whole record, the message in the song is to “fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation that you’re in — whatever it is that you don’t like.”The song talks about Fiona’s relationship with her self image and how she was poorly judged in her early career. As she found her own voice and didn’t need to please the media anymore, this is her response. Now, she’s the one to say: “whatever happens, I’m still here”."
Fiona apple,For her,"This song grew out of a recording session held shortly after the nomination hearings of theSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh; like many women, Apple felt scalded with rage about survivors of sexual violence being disbelieved.Donald Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States wasaccused of sexual misconductby three women in September 2018. One of them witnessed efforts by author and journalist Mark Judge, Kavanaugh and others to “cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ‘gang-raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys.”After multitracking her voice to form a gospel-like chorus at the end of the song,Fiona saidshe wanted the final result to be uncompromising: “I want primary colors. I don’t want any half measures.”"
Fiona apple,I know,"The last song on 1999’sWhen the Pawn…is a poignant sketch of an affair with a man who is already in a committed relationship. It probably is the song that comes the most close to a “real” love song on the record, but there are still uncanny images (“crowbar”) and skepticism enough to make it a classic doubtful Fiona Apple song.Elvis Costello has covered this song in return for Fiona’s great cover of his “I Want You”."
Fiona apple,I want you to love me,"The opening track of Fetch The Bolt Cutters, “I Want You to Love Me”, was initially addressed to a hypothetical lover, but was eventually influenced by Apple’s relationship with writer Jonathan Ames, as well as by a period of meditation in 2010–11, at Spirit Rock Meditation Center, Woodacre, California. The latter experience is explored in the line “And I know when I go all my particles disband and disperse / and I’ll be back in the pulse,” which explores a breakthrough she achieved following a throbbing headache, where she witnessed “a pulsing space between the people at the retreat—a suggestion of something larger”."
Fiona apple,Ladies,"This song was first performed live by Fiona Apple andBlake Millsat a 2013 show in Portland. Back then, it was titled“Don’t Get Rid of It (You’d Look Good In It)”and also known as “Tipple” by fans.In 2017, Apple sang it at Ohana Festival, confirmed it was going to be on the album, and revealed the final title: “Ladies.”"
Fiona apple,Paper bag,"“Paper Bag”, track 5 onWhen the Pawn(1999) was also the third and final single from the record. Communicated through the metaphor of the paper bag, the song shows how hope can lead to disappointment.Theinspirationfor the song came from a mostly true story from her own life, although the titular bag was in fact plastic rather than paper."
Fiona apple,Shameika,"“Shameika” is the second song offFiona Apple’s fifth album,Fetch the Bolt Cutters.The March 2020New Yorkerprofileof Fiona Apple explains the inspiration behind this song:In “Shameka” [sic] she celebrates a key moment in middle school, when a tough girl told the bullied Apple, ‘You have potential.’Applesaidwhen she first wrote the song she wasn’t “entirely convinced” Shameika existed. However, after the “New Yorker"" article came out, a teacher Apple had kept in touch with over the years emailed her saying, “I heard you wrote about Shameika. I can see her …” and sent a picture. Apple said of the picture: ""I had remembered that maybe she was a bully or something. Then I got sent this picture of her, and she’s so cute — she doesn’t look like a bully at all. She’s just got this big smile on her face.”"
Fiona apple,Valentine,"Track #3 onFiona Apple’s fourth studio albumThe Idler Wheel Is Wiser than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More than Ropes Will Ever Do.Fiona Apple first played this song at Largo on Valentine’s Day, 2007, and it subsequently appeared on her 2012 album. She said at the time that the song was not about a man or a lover but instead was about a girl she admired and would like to be more like."
Hozier,Eat your young,"“Eat Your Young” sees Hozier describe a feast being prepared and served together with the chaos that comes with it. According to the artist, the track is a taste of the9 Circles of Hellmore specifically the 3rd Circle,Gluttony.This is based on the first part ofDante Alighieri’sepic poem known asDivine Comedy.The title could be alluding to the 1729 satirical essay,‘A Modest Proposal’byJonathan Swift,where he suggests, as a solution to poverty in Ireland at the time, that the poor should sell their children to be cannibalised by the rich.The track was first revealed on 24th February 2023 in a post on Hozier’ssocials, together with artwork and tracklist of the EP. This was followed by the firstsnippetof the track with the words;This was followed by the secondsnippetwith a hand doodling drawing and the song playing in the background."
Hozier,From eden,“From Eden” is the title song of Hozier’s second EP.He sayshe wrote it in a tongue-in-cheek way from the point of view of the devil looking at something innocent and seeing it as a missing part. The song tries to woo a woman while admitting that the relationship would be deeply flawed.
Hozier,Nina cried power,"Nina Cried Poweris a classic look on protest songs. The song is a bit of a tribute toNina Simoneand mentions other artists such asMarvin Gaye,John Lennon,B.B. KingandCurtis Mayfield.Hozier sings alongside another popular artist of her timeMavis Staples.When asked about the song Hozier stated;[It’s] a suggestion that the battle for equality these artists championed remains an ongoing and necessary one. “The fights that took place 100 years ago or 200 years ago for whatever — civil rights or workers' right etc. — don’t stop. There is no final victory. [Staples is] the most amazing person, just fucking unbelievable. [Her] energy is still absolutely there.”Source:Rolling StoneOn his Instagram Stories of March 6th 2019, Hozier confirmed the original version of Nina Cried Power was over five minutes and that there was a possibility for release, but that the edited version was the one who made it to the album. The extended version can be heard here:And the lyrics can be consultedhere."
Hozier,Shrike,"“Shrike” is about a relationship that has been lost, and the frustration and sadness that comes with the regret of not appreciating what was had when he had it. The relationship may not have been positive at all times but there was a deep connection that will most definitely be missed. Hozier wishes that in his next life this person will understand that they will not go unappreciated. He will portray his love through the reliance of a shrike on its providing thorn."
Hozier,Someone new,"“Someone new” is the fourth song of Hozier’s self-titled studio album.This song describes how he sees love as a way of distraction from life’s struggles. The song also talks about there’s no right way to fall in love and you can fall in love with someone anytime, in any way."
Hozier,Take me to church,"“Take Me to Church” is the debut single by Irish recording artistHozier. It has become an international hit, reaching #1 in 12 countries, and has been certified five times platinum in the US. “Take Me to Church” wasnominatedfor a Grammy Award for“Song of the Year”in2015.Despite its widespread and international success, Hozier was a struggling musician when he recorded the song. And in fact, it wasn’t until the music video — a critique ofRussia’s anti-LGBT+ policy, which some audiences have found controversial — went viral that the song attracted attention.“‘Take Me to Church’ is essentially about sex,” Hozier said in aninterview withNew York Magazinein March 2014, adding that “it’s not an attack on faith.”It’s about sex and it’s about humanity, and obviously sex and humanity are incredibly tied. Sexuality, and sexual orientation — regardless of orientation — is just natural… The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love.The song has also garnered attention from musicians around the world — it was, for example, covered onThe Voice, and directorDavid LaChapellereleased aninterpretive dance videoof “Take Me To Church”, featuring British Royal Ballet veteranSergei Poluninperforming choreography byJade Hale-Christofi."
Hozier,Too sweet,"In “Too Sweet” Hozier draws a contrast between two individuals with different lifestyles and preferences, one who enjoys living life at his own pace, indulging in simple pleasures like whiskey, coffee, and late nights while not worrying too much about conforming to societal norms of waking up early and living a disciplined life, and a second individual, presumably the partner, is portrayed as someone who values discipline, health, and structure. They encourage the narrator to live a healthier lifestyle, waking up early and taking care of themselves.Born from the 3rd Circle of Hell,Gluttony, same as his track,“Eat Your Young”, Hozier examines excessiveness and overindulgence, similar to Dante’s depiction of gluttony where it not only refers to overconsumption of food and drink but also the overindulgence in any worldly pleasure to the detriment of spiritual growth.The track was first teased on March 6, 2024, during an interview with Chris Black and Jon Stewart for their podcastHow Long Goneepisode614, a second time during the officialannouncementof theUnheard EPand finally on aposton his socials celebrating his first time in Chile for Lollapalooza."
Hozier,Work song,"This is the only song on Hozier’s self titled album to have a title that is not entirely composed of lyrics from the song.The song is about the love of a worker’s life lending him strength during a hard day’s work. The song encompasses indie with strong influences on folk, blues and negro spirituals."
Kings of leon,Beautiful war,"An atmospheric, mid-tempo ballad which, with its sterling, confident Caleb vocals, sibling harmonies, and understated power, seems destined to be a classic and a mainstay in the KOL setlist.“That song was written years ago, the same weekend I wrote ‘Use Somebody,’” Caleb says. “It was a slow, country song. Angelo had a bunch of notes, reminders of what songs were, and he had one that said, ‘what is this?’ I started strumming it on acoustic and playing it, and the guys listened and thought it was great. They had heard it for years, they just didn’t realize it, and as soon as everybody picked up their instruments, it completely transformed from a slow country song, to a tempo, as soon as Jared started I was like, That. Feels. Awesome.‘ That song came together pretty quickly, too, and it’s definitely a song that I’m very proud of.”http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/album-review/5719498/kings-of-leon-talk-mechanical-bull-album-track-by-track"
Kings of leon,Closer,"This song is about a lovesick vampireThere is a remix to this song on their follow up album Come Around Sundown that gives it a little more dreary tone.Rolling Stone has it on a list of Top Vampire songs.​http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=12984Kings of Leon, 'Closer'—Rolling StoneThe vampire in Kings of Leon's 2008 hit ""Closer"" is a 200-year old creep who doesn't feel even a trace of remorse when he bleeds his victims dry. Even still, Caleb Followill sings the song with an anguished tone that pushes the listener to identify with the plight of this monster in spite of themselves."
Kings of leon,I want you,"“I Want You” is the ninth track on Kings of Leon’s fourth album,Only by the Night."
Kings of leon,Pyro,A lot of girls are looking for a guy to define them (as a cornerstone is used to define all parts of an edifice in blueprints)It’s annoying.. (for the guy)
Kings of leon,Sex on fire,"Kings of Leon released their fourth album later the month on this release, their second in successive years, and by rights the Nashville quartet would’ve be running short on ideas by now. Their brand of whiskey-stained Southern rock could only be entertaining for so long, right?Well, actually, wrong. “Sex on Fire” proves there was still plenty of fuel in the Followill clan’s tank and more than justifies their recent leap to festival headliner status."
Kings of leon,Supersoaker,"With a music video filmed in a Super 8 and one that its director, Andrew Whiston (a.k.a W.I.Z), could onlydescribe as: “an imagined hybrid of pop-art screenprint, hand tinting and Technicolour film,” “Supersoaker” is the first single, as well as the first track off of their 2013 album,Mechanical Bull.When asked about the track, vocalist Caleb Followill says it was written with an inspiration towards their second album,Aha Shake Heartbreak, as well as an unidentified person from another band and how they lost their inspiration."
Kings of leon,Use somebody,"As he mentions here, Caleb was feeling blue on medication and alcohol after a surgery, when he wrote the lyrics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XHwLn9kPqc"
Kings of leon,Wait for me,"“Kings of Leon have released the next single off their upcoming Mechanical Bull, out September 24th. ""Wait for Me” slows things down with a mid-tempo love song that’s equal parts plea and confession.“ –Rolling Stone"
Kings of leon,Walls,"The second single, and the title track, whichearned a video,released September 22 2016. The song is a slow burner, with the beat resembling a heartbeat. “When the walls come down” is a saying usually relating to some emotional turmoil, and Caleb’s lyrics seem to trace a tortured path through heartbreak and pain."
Kings of leon,Waste a moment,"Another story-telling song, Caleb and co follow a waitress from “Waco to WeHo,” and through her difficult relationship with a hardened man. It’s a small town tale given a huge sonic backdrop.The first single from the record, it earned avideoand a rollout which sawNMEreviewing the track.Despite the band covering that issue, the publication called the song out for it’s huge chorus “that takes itself slightly too serious.”"
Lana del rey,Born to die,"“Born to Die” isdescribedbyLana Del Reyas a “homage to true love and a tribute to living life on the wild side.” To quote Chelsea Hodson fromNew York Times, “In [Lana’s] melancholy world, to love is to live, so to love the wrong person is to be “born to die.”It is the opening track from herstudio albumof the same name, released as the second single from the LP.The music video was released on December 14th, 2011, receiving generally positive reviews. She spoke withMTVabout its background:For “Born To Die,” I wrote a treatment for it called “The Lonely Queen,” so that I would be in a setting that represented Heaven, sort of in like a remote castle in Romania. Walking through the halls flanked by tigers. And then she’d be flashing back to happier times in the arms of her love. And then Yoann Lemoine adapted that treatment and made it more doable. But I love that video. I really do. I can’t believe it turned out so beautifully. I spent a lot of time thinking about where I wanted it to go."
Lana del rey,Love,"“Love” sees Lana treading her familiar themes of nostalgia for an idealized American past.She muses on how this generation’s youth maintain a sense of wonder and empowerment in the face of adversity, due in part to the romanticized idea of love driving them forward. This alternative/indie rock track also touches upon the concept of loving others, as well as loving oneself. Gone are the self-destructive behaviors involving endless sex, drugs, and alcohol, which would offer her fun and pleasure that lasted until her next dose.Theofficial music videofor the song was released on February 20th, 2017."
Lana del rey,Lust for life,"Not to be confused with the classicIggy Popsongandalbumof the same name, the title track from Lana Del Rey’s fifth studio album, “Lust For Life” captures the essence of both Lana and Abel’s will to live. The moments when the two are doing what they love, with whom they love, remind them that life is worthwhile. In true Lana fashion, the song raids the larder of American pop culture, with nods toIggy,’60s girl groups, and evenBilly Joel.After earlierteasing the collaboration onTwitter,the track was officially released on April 19, 2017. It’s thefirst songwritten for her eponymous album, it marks Lana andThe Weeknd’s fourth collaboration following“Prisoner,”“Party Monster”and“Stargirl Interlude.”Lana initially worked with the Swedish hitmakerMax Martinon the track, before finalizing it with the help of Abel and Nowels.The titleLust for Lifewas first used forIrving Stone’s 1934biographical novelaboutVincent Van Gogh. The phrase had also been used to name songs and albums byIggy Pop,Drake,Childish Gambino,GirlsandHeavenly."
Lana del rey,Norman fucking rockwell,"The title track of Lana Del Rey’ssixth studio albumspeaks about an immature, pretentious poet. There’s a link to this song on“Venice Bitch,”the second song released from the album:Paint me happy in blueNorman RockwellDel Rey shared a snippet of the song onInstagramon June 15th, 2019.The song went on to earn a Grammy nomination for “Song of the Year” at the 2020 Grammys."
Lana del rey,Summertime sadness,"“Summertime Sadness” explores the atmosphere of a bittersweet summertime where Lana danced, cruised and felt electrified with a loved one. This song became a sleeper success from adance remix by Cedric Gervais. The remix entered the Top 50 in the UK, the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it topped the US Dance/Electronic songs chart.The accompanying music videocreated great speculation over its underlying message. It depicts a tragedy where one woman (played by Lana Del Rey) jumps and the other (Jamie King), heartbroken, follows. Due to this, some claim that the song was written for a personal friend of Lana’s that committed suicide, or that it was written for a boyfriend that died years ago. However, there is absolutely no evidence of this, and many believe these speculations to be false in their entirety."
Lana del rey,Video games,"Considered Lana Del Rey’s breakthrough hit, “Video Games” served as the first single off the artist’s wildly successful sophomore studio album and major label debut,Born to Die. The song was notably certified 2x multi-platinum by theRIAAin 2021 — ten years after its release.“Video Games” is a baroque, downtempo pop ballad in which Del Rey, although ignored by her significant other, resolves to love him anyway. The song’s lyrics refer to two broken relationships in the singer’s past. In a statement, the American artist said of the song’s meaning:The verse was about the way things were with one person, and the chorus was the way I wished things had really been with another person, who I thought about for a long time.It’s a song about letting go of my musical ambitions and settling down into a simple life with a person I loved.

Lana del rey,Young and beautiful,"From the soundtrack for the 2013 film version ofThe Great Gatsby. The song was also featured inthe second trailer released for the film, and used throughout the film as a motif of Gatsby and Daisy’s relationship.According to Del Rey:It was an honor to work with Baz Lurhmann on his amazing adaptation of one of the most extraordinary books ever written. The movie is highly glamorous and exciting; Rick Nowels and I were thrilled to write the song for the film.“Young and Beautiful” was penned by Lana and the film’s director, co-writer, and co-producer Baz Luhrmann, for the soundtrack. Del Rey wrote an earlier version of the song for herParadiseEP,but re-worked itwith Luhrmann after he heard it and decided it’d work great with the movie. The song served as the film’s kickoff single, and an “orchestral single” featuring an orchestra was also released.

Led zeppelin,All my love,"Robert Plant wrote this song forhis son who diedwhile he was on tour. It’s one of the three songs Robert Plant dedicated to his son’s memory. The other two are“Blue Train”and“I Believe”. Neither of them were Led Zeppelin era songs.Released in 1979 in as part of the albumIn Through the Out Door, it was their last studio album of new material."
Led zeppelin,Black dog,"“Black Dog,” named after aLabrador dogthat wandered around the studio while Led Zeppelin was recording, sees Robert Plant lamenting about a failed relationship with agold digger.Although the title was inspired by an actual dog, the term “black dog” has been used torefer to negative emotions,as well as aHellhound,a mythical creature that follows someone before they die.The song’s iconic guitar riff was considered hard to play even by Jimmy Page. This may partially be because the riff (written by bassist John Paul Jones) is in the time signature of 9/8, while drummer John Bonham played in 4/4."
Led zeppelin,Dazed and confused,"“Dazed and Confused” is a rework of asongfrom Jimmy Page’s earlier band, Yardbirds, which is in turn a rework of a track byJake Holmes.Holmes eventuallysued Led Zeppelinfor ownership of the song, and the lawsuit wasdismissed.Zeppelin albums then credited Holmes as a writer.The song itself sees the narrator pondering whether or not to leave a toxic relationship.Performanceswould often last longer than twenty minutes, with varying arrangements. It is also one of the few Led Zeppelin songs in which Jimmy Page plays his guitar using a violin bow.The title of this song inspired the title of the cult-classicfilm of the same name,a 1993 movie taking place in 1976."
Led zeppelin,Going to california,"A hauntingly beautiful acoustic tune released on the legendary untitledLed Zeppelin IV, the song tells the story of a man who has left his unkind woman and is off to California with dreams and hopes of finding his real love."
Led zeppelin,Immigrant song,"One of the band’s most iconic releases, “Immigrant Song” likens the band’s trip to Iceland to Norse warriors setting out to colonize America. It’s a short and pumping rocking tune down to the opening riff and barbarian wail.The lyrics, as explained by Robert Plant anddocumented by Wikipedia,are influenced by the band visiting Iceland, aland first settled by Vikings:We weren’t being pompous (about the song)… We did come from the land of the ice and snow. We were guests of the Icelandic Government on a cultural mission. We were invited to play a concert in Reykjavik and the day before we arrived all the civil servants went on strike and the gig was going to be cancelled. The university prepared a concert hall for us and it was phenomenal. The response from the kids was remarkable and we had a great time. ‘Immigrant Song’ was about that trip and it was the opening track on the album that was intended to be incredibly different."
Led zeppelin,Kashmir,"“Kashmir,” one of Led Zeppelin’s signature songs, was written after LZ’s 1973 tour, about a drive through an area ofMorocco.As documented byWikipedia,Robert Plant told music journalistCameron Crowe:The whole inspiration came from the fact that the road went on and on and on. It was a single-track road which neatly cut through the desert. Two miles to the East and West were ridges of sandrock. It basically looked like you were driving down a channel, this dilapidated road, and there was seemingly no end to it.“Kashmir” is both a fan favorite and a live staple that was played at nearly every concert after its release. It features one of the most memorable LZ riffs."
Led zeppelin,Ramble on,"“Ramble On” likens the life journey that the band members were on to find “the one” to the journey taken by Frodo and Sam in theLord of the Ringsfranchise to find and destroy theOne Ring.In both cases, the voyage is taxing — the band must constantly travel the world, playing high-energy shows along the way, while the One Ring can become all-consuming to anyone who carries it. However, in both cases, they must continue on their journey, or “ramble on.”"
Led zeppelin,Stairway to heaven,"“Stairway to Heaven” is one of Led Zeppelin’s most famous recordings,with many considering it the greatest rock song of all time.It tells the story of a greedy woman who is overly optimistic about her unpromising future.The song resonated with young listeners, opening up a door to a different realm of spirituality and transporting them into a more mystical view of life. The vagueness of the lyrics also allows listeners to interpret the song in their own way, adding to the magic and mystery of the track."
Led zeppelin,Thank you,"“Thank You” is a ballad off Led Zeppelin’s second album, Led Zeppelin II. It features John Paul Jones on organ and has lyrics completely written by Robert Plant. It’s a tribute to his then-wife Maureen.“To me it was kind of almost uncharacteristic of other stuff off that album. It sounds like a 60s pop song to me – the way that they have it arranged. And it’s almost like that would’ve been, with any other band, would’ve been their biggest hit, but because it was Led Zeppelin and the album was so unbelievable and it was their [second] album, [the other songs within the album] almost kind of passed over it” – Chris Cornell on The Howard Stern Show in 2011."
Led zeppelin,Whole lotta love,"“Whole Lotta Love” is Led Zeppelin’s most sexually explicit song — “love” can be replaced by both “sex” and “penis” in different sections. The track  was largely inspired by Willie Dixon’s blues track“You Need Love,”recorded byMuddy Waters.A1972 lawsuitsaw Dixon sue the band for copyright infringement, and Dixon was later credited.Acoverof the song by Collective Consciousness Society was used as the theme song of BBC TV’sTop of the Pops, a music program that aired from 1964 to 2006."

Sonically, the song features prominent piano, isolated vocals, and warm harmonies – complimentary to the themes of emotional intimacy and vulnerability as presented in the lyrics.Much like their previous ballads“Half A Heart”and“Little Things”, “If I Could Fly” is a prime example of the softer, less stadium-centric production the boys aimed to deliver throughout this album. Delving into acoustics alongside a straight-forward sentiment, the combination creates an intimate atmosphere – either as an ode to a distant lover, or a dedication to the fans in lieu of the hiatus."

The lumineers,Ho hey,"Ranked at #36 in United StatesWesley Schultz is trying to do the right things the right way, whether it’s in a relationship or in life in general. Although he does say, “it”, which might means he’s trying to do what he’s going through right.Even though he’s trying to do the right things, his life is lonely. He’s not happy…there is something missing causing him to feel lonliness even though he’s trying to do right, which should bring happiness.He doesn’t know what he did and when that started the chain of events in action? He doesn’t know why she left him? He doesn’t know how he got so lonely and lost even without her since he’s been trying to do all the right things. Or maybe he thought doing all the right things would bring her back somehow.He’s not able to tell her these things or they’re not communicating this or she’s not seeing what all he’s doing. A song is a romantic way to tell someone you miss them, or maybe the song is to make himself feel better.if she would have went to where he was he’d be standing by someone else that wasn’t her, and how would she have felt or what would she have thought? Would that be right? And he’s talking about what it would have been … past tense, was there someone else back then and now he wants her back and she’s moving on and he doesn’t think she’s right for any other guy but him?The bleeding means life, and seeing his family will bring him back to life, but his life is feeling like it’s fading and he doesn’t want to lose everything he’s been trying to do right while waiting on her. So, obviously, this is a love note in form of a song so he could say it the way he felt it."

Zach bryan,Bass boat,"On arguably the most emotionally vulnerable song from the album, elite storyteller Zach Bryan returns to his childhood memories for inspiration while addressing themes of nostalgia, family, and religion. He reflects on his parental relationships and how they have shaped his adulthood and eventual fatherhood.The first two verses introduce nostalgia for his youth and the pain he feels now due to the relationships or lack thereof with his parents. This continues in the third verse of the song where he states,“Cause I was raised by a woman who was hardly impressedAnd I carry that shit real deep in my chest”Furthermore, an apology will only go so far and asks for four minutes (song length is  3:37) to reconcile the relationship with his mother and move on. Finally, he uses a double entendre to finish the third verse as a child of his mother and of God. However, prayer will not heal his pain as he was never ‘raised’ by either.Though the song’s tone is sad, he offers a theme of hope in both chorus' where he will ‘show’ his children the unconditional love he never felt from his parents by kissing their cut knees or working long hours to afford a home.The backdrop of scattered piano keys presents the track as a reflection of how his childhood has shaped him into who he is today."

Zach bryan,Tourniquet,"Zach Bryan’s “Tourniquet” is a tender plea to someone struggling with their mental health, offering them help. Bryan uses physical injury and the need for medical attention as metaphors for the subject’s damaged mental health and need for psychological help. While Bryan has not publicly commented on it, he is likely the person struggling with mental health. Bryan went through a divorce, with public rumors that he cheated on his ex-wife. It is unclear who the narrator (the one helping) is. If the narrator is his ex-wife, then the song is perhaps an apology, an acknowledgement that she supported him and he betrayed her. Alternatively, the narrator could be a friend or family member that helped him through the divorce.The song is either directly or indirectly inspired by the famous playA Streetcar Named Desireby Tennesse Williams, as the interlude features a sound clip from the 1951 movie adaptation. Mental health is a central theme of that piece. Bryan perhaps compares himself to Stanley, Stella’s abusive and overall deplorable husband.Prior to being released on Bryan’s 2023 self-titled, self-produced album, the song was teased in aTikTokvideo."
