Coldplay,Adventure of a lifetime,"The groovy fifth track on Coldplay’s dynamicA Head Full of Dreamstakes a step into disco, with a simplistic song about life and love, backed by a funky dance floor beat. It features a prominent guitar riff thatwas inspired by the riff on Guns N' Roses “Sweet Child O' Mine.”According to bassist Guy Berryman,[The track] started as a freeform musical session and was called something else, Legends or something. It had a different chord sequence and different hooks and one-by-one things were taken away and things got added."
Coldplay,Clocks,"Continuing the existential themes ofA Rush of Blood to the Head, “Clocks” opens with a haunting piano melody intoChris Martin’s falsetto vocals.The song concerns the paradox facing humanity: an obsession with time and punctuality versus a desire to savor every moment and “seize the day.” The lyrics speak to this universal existential anxiety.Several remixes exist of the song, and there are many samples of the piano riff used throughout the song. “Clocks” was well received by critics and even won “Record of the Year” at the 2004 Grammy Awards."
Coldplay,Everglow,"The most personal and emotionally-charged song onColdplay’s enigmaticA Head Full of Dreams, “Everglow” expresses memory and loss as an ever-lasting “glow.”Most likely inspired by his own divorce from actressGwyneth Paltrow, songwriter Chris Martin statedduring an interview with Zane Lowe:To me, [the song] is about — whether it’s a loved one or a situation or a friend or a relationship that’s finished, or someone’s passed away — I was thinking about, after you’ve been through the sadness of something, you also get this everglow. That’s what it’s about."
Coldplay,Fix you,"“Fix You” is the fourth track and second single from Coldplay’s third albumX&Y. It was written byChris Martinfor his then-wife,Gwyneth Paltrow, to comfort her after her father passed away.The song has been covered numerous times, including notable renditions by theYoung@Heartchorusin theaward-winning2007documentary, as well as pop iconSam Smith, and Korean septetBTS."
Coldplay,Hymn for the weekend,"Coldplay’sQueen Bduet is an ode to enjoying a significant other you love and cherish.In an interview, Martin described the origins of the collaboration and its sound:I thought I’d like to have a song called “Drinks on Me” where you sit on the side of a club and buy everyone drinks because you’re so fucking cool. I was chuckling about that, when this melody came – “drinks on me, drinks on me” – then the rest of the song came out. I presented it to the rest of the band and they said, “We love this song, but there’s no way you can sing ‘drinks on me.’” So that changed into “drink from me” and the idea of having an angelic person in your life. Then that turned into asking Beyoncé to sing on it.It’s one of four collaborations on the album; the others areTove Loon“Fun”,Gwyneth Paltrowon“Everglow”, and aBarack Obamasample on“Kaleidoscope.”Apparently, Beyoncé also made their album90% better.She made our album 90% better. And we were already 20% good. So now we’re like 110% the band we used to be. You do the math.Before the album’s December 4, 2015 release date,it was previewed on Twitteron November 24, 2015.The official music videowas uploaded on the 29th of January."
Coldplay,Sparks,"“Sparks” is an acoustic song by the British rock bandColdplay. It’s the fourth track off of Coldplay’s debut album,Parachutes.This acoustic love song is about a person who tries to get someone to remember them again. They go on about their relationship, and how he saw “sparks” of love when they were together."
Coldplay,The scientist,"“The Scientist” is a very mellow song about trying to analyze a broken relationship.The song’s melody is inspired by“Don’t Look Back in Anger”by theOasis, especially the piano part.The music video is famous for its reverse chronology (which required Chris Martin to learn the song backwards in order to make it look like he was singing forwards as he walked backwards…).  Although the video fits the song well, the idea for the videocame to Director Jamie Thraves independently; he then waited for the perfect song to match his concept."
Coldplay,Viva la vida,"Revered as anessential rock songof the 2000s, “Viva La Vida” tells the story of a monarch who’s lost his kingdom. In another aspect, the song is also seen as anarrative on the French Revolutiongiven the historical and biblical references in the lyrics. The instrumental is based around a string and piano background, led by an orchestral drum beat.The title derives from the Spanish phrase “Long Live Life,” and takes its name fromFrida Kahlo’slast paintingbefore her death. During a March 2008interview withRolling Stone, frontman Chris Martin explained the reason for naming the song and album in honour of Kahlo:She went through a lot of shit, of course, and then she started a big painting in her house that said ‘Viva la Vida.’ I just loved the boldness of it.This song debuted to massive success and acclaim, peaking at number one on both theBillboard100andUK Singles Chart. Coldplay received several awards for the track, includingSong of the Yearat theGrammy Awardsin February 2009.The chorus has musical similarities toJoe Satriani’s instrumental piece,“If I Could Fly.”Satrianisued Coldplayfor plagiarism—they settled out of court. The bandCreaky Boardsalso accused Coldplay of taking the song’s melody from their record,“The Songs I Didn’t Write,”however, Coldplay denied the allegations.Coldplay released two music videos for this song.Hype Williamsmade theofficial video, which premiered in August 2008, depicting the band against a backdrop ofEugène Delacroix’s painting,Liberty Leading the People. Thealternate music videodropped alongside the first one but was directed byAnton Corbijnand starred Chris Martin as a king."
Coldplay,Yellow,"“Yellow” is the fifth track and second single from Coldplay’s 2000 debut albumParachutes.It is one of their oldest and most enduring hits, continuing to be a celebrated staple of live performances even today.The title of the song came from the feel of the band during its composition, which was described as filled with “brightness and hope and devotion.” However, the lyrical content was inspired by lead singerChris Martin’s“unrequited love”.(Source:Coldplay: Nobody Said It Was Easyby Martin Roach)"
Declan mckenna,Brazil,"“Brazil” is Declan McKenna’s debut single. It was initially self-released throughhis own YouTube channelon December 2014. It gained international recognition after its re-release in August 2015, after McKennawonGlastonbury Festival’s Emerging Talent Competition.“Brazil” is a protest song criticizingFIFA, the international governing body of association football, and their decision of awarding the2014 FIFA World Cupto Brazil, without addressing the extensive and deep poverty affecting Brazilians and“doing anything for the communities.”Although the song was just intended to be a dig at corruption, it took a whole new life with theFIFA corruption scandalthat emerged in 2015 and has been deeply associated with the downfall from office ofSepp Blatter,FIFA’s president from 1998 to 2015."
Declan mckenna,British bombs,"Declan has never been shy of voicing his opinions on political issues, and “British Bombs” is no exception. The track wassparked by a conversation Declan had, about “Britain being at war all the time” and the United Kingdom’s foreign policies, specifically arms trade.All of the track’s proceeds are going to charity,  with Declan tellingDIY Magazine:I want to see them (the funds) help people who are impacted by what I’m talking about. […] I think war and the sales of arms around the world is such a big thing that we don’t even see the impact of. So hopefully we can help some people that have been affected by these issues."
Declan mckenna,Humongous,"“Humongous” is the first track from Declan McKenna’s debut full-length albumWhat Do You Think About the Car?. The song is the fifth single from the album that was released on June 9th, 2017. Themusic videofor the track when the single was released.(Humongous is a) bit reflective of the last couple of years of just seeing so much written about me, and actually just being like a teenager who finds it hard to take in a lot of criticism but positivity as well. They both can be equally damaging and equally difficult to understand, and I think I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve started analyzing that and started understanding myself a little bit more. So “Humungous” sort of looks back on these two years and yeah, it’s a little bit melancholic despite the sort of powerful chorus type thing, it is a little bit emo.- Declan McKenna for Billboard"
Declan mckenna,Isombard,"Isombardcaptures the stumbling dialogue of a ‘right wing Fox News-type TV presenter’ centered around the topic of police brutality and xenophobia. This isn’t the first time Declan McKenna has touched on sociopolitical issues. His breakout singleBrazil, touched upon the miserable nature of football within the social hemisphere of Brazil, andParacetamoldealt with the misrepresentation of transgender people in the media.McKenna notes thatIsombardis loosely based on“next to of course god america i”, a poem mocking the patriotism of Americans by E. E. Cummings. The poem suggests that patriotism has developed into a competition of pride amongst people, rather than a genuine love for the country, and mocks the way in which typical patriots would praise their country with closed minds and blindness. This closed-minded ideal can be seen throughout the song.Declan has confessed that “Isombard” is actually spelt wrong and when he sent the demo he made a mistake but prefers “Isombard” over “Isambard” anyway."
Declan mckenna,Listen to your friends,"On February 21st, 2017, while on tour, Declan premiered “Listen to Your Friends” as alive performanceon his tour and said“I was writing this song in L.A when I was with a friend and I like it and it’s actually the last track on my album that I’ve made that you haven’t heard yet.”“Listen to Your Friends” is the first song Declan wrote with someone else, and the only song from the album not predominately written in his bedroom.  The song features an artist from one of Declan’s favourite bands, formerVampire WeekendmemberRostam Batmanglij."
Declan mckenna,Make me your queen,"“Make Me Your Queen” is the fifth track from Declan’s debut LPWhat Do You Think About the Car?about a relationship between two people that could become abusive.  Talking toDIY MagazineDeclan had this to say about the song:(in the relationship there is) “the assumption that one person is a king and they’re possessing someone else because the queen is the second most important person.” (It has the subtext of) being patronised, with connotations surrounding the patriarchal society that we have.”"
Declan mckenna,Paracetamol,"“Paracetamol” is the second single from Declan’s debut albumWhat Do You Think About The Car?The song was inspired by transgender teen Leelah Alcorn,who committed suicide in 2014.In aninterview with The GuardianDeclan said:It was a disgusting story. Not only must it have been a truly horrific experience for Leelah, but knowing that this wasn’t an isolated case genuinely terrified me. So I wrote this song called Paracetamol – without really noticing it at first – from the perspective of this ambiguous authoritative figure, talking about somebody they are oppressing, in a sort of disconnected tabloid speak… Paracetamol is not written specifically about Leelah’s case, but about sections of the media’s representation of LGBT communities in general. On the odd occasion, they are represented, the media tends to handle it so horribly that the cumulative effect is that their readers – quite understandably – just don’t quite get it either."""
Declan mckenna,The key to life on earth,"The second single of Declan McKenna’s sophomore album,Zeroswas premiered onRadio 1’s Future Soundswith Annie Mac on April 14, 2020.In “The Key to Life on Earth”, Declan sings about youth in suburban London and the way human beings act toward one another.The track’smusic videodropped less than 24 hours after the song, featuringAlex Lawther, a British actor who wascompared to Declan(and vice-versa) following his portrayal of James in the television seriesThe End of the F***ing World."
Declan mckenna,Why do you feel so down,"“Why Do You Feel So Down” is the ninth track from Declan’s debut LPWhat Do You Think About the Car?In the album’s fanzine Declan said this about the song:I really don’t know where the whole sparkly slacker pop thing came from but it happened, I think it’s because the whole song is kind of jokey making fun of myself (and a lot of other things) so it came out as an almost pisstake dance tune, but it’s also a bit sad (LOLMAO). It’s a lot of things, I think I was just 16 when I started on this one. I was a confused baby."
Deftones,7 words,"7 Wordsis the first single of Deftones' first studio album,Adrenaline.It is one of the few songs of that era that are still played at Deftones' shows. It is a common set-closer.The song title refers to the police statement, “You have the right to remain silent.”In an interview, frontmanChino Morenogoes into detail:I wrote it back when I was 16 years old. It’s probably one of the angriest songs I’ve ever written. It was about being oppressed by people around me, the authorities, I felt like the whole world was against me. It was like I was lashing out at those people.""A common meaning of the song is about police lashing out against minorities only due to their style or skin color, when they have done nothing wrong at all."
Deftones,Cherry waves,"4th song of the album Saturday Night Wrist.Singer Chino Moreno has stated this song is about testing the trust a person has in someone else.Cherry Waves is somewhat of a metaphor for blood in an ocean. Chino repeatedly drops subtle mentions of death throughout the song. On the other hand, the Cherry also symbolizes warmth and tenderness and love. He juxtaposes love and death throughout the song in the form of these “Cherry Waves”."
Deftones,Digital bath,"Upon first listen, “Digital Bath” is a hauntingly beautiful song that could be played during a late-night cruise.One critic says:“Digital Bath”, “Knife Prty”, and “Change” are all defined by the ghostly samples in the background that perfectly match Chino’s vocals and the wonderful harmonic phrasing on those songs.Diving farther into the song, however, we learn that it is about luring a girl into a bathtub, killing her with an electrical device, and then dressing her back up.Chino Moreno, lead vocalist of Deftones, on “Digital Bath”:The song itself, if you took the lyrics out of it and you listen to just the melodies and the song, you wouldn’t think that it would be a violent song. It’s a prettier, spacier song.A separate quote from Chino from the same source:It was probably 5 in the morning – we were still up partying – and I just pictured this whole scenario of having this girl, bringing her downstairs and taking a bath and like, out of nowhere, just reaching back and electrocuting – basically throwing some kind of electrical device in the bathtub and then taking her out of the bath and drying her off and putting her clothes back on."
Deftones,Knife prty,"Knife Prtyis the seventh track of Deftones' third studio album,White Pony. The song features vocals from female singerRodleen GetsicThe opening chords forKnife Prtylead into a distorted introduction with a moving bass line and a vocal bridge sung by Getsic in Spanish-Arabic stylesays onecritic.Chino Moreno, the frontman of Deftones, had this to say:It’s a seductive song with a lot of violent imagery. People don’t tend to like sex mixed with violence. The mid section has amazing vocals from a girl called Rodleen who worked next door to our studioThe inspiration for this song was a strange party on the band’s tour bus once, where a everyone had a knife from Abe’s knife collection and was dancing around the bus with them. Chino then created an imaginary scenario from it about a secret knife society.I made up this fake scenario of some kind of underworld society of knives, people who just get off on these erotic fantasies…or something like that. An ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ kind of thingChino says.Symbolically speaking, it is an intimate story where a man (in this case, Chino) and a woman build their attraction. They either get high off of each other’s aurora, or with the use of drugs.They both climax (potentially in different ways), and Chino is left wanting more."
Deftones,Mascara,"Mascarais written about Chino’s then-wife, Celeste. He describes in aninterviewthat his former wife hardly listened to his music. He describes a time when she listened in the car with him. After it finished, she had no reaction, which frustrated him tremendously."
Deftones,Passenger,"The ninth song from the group’s third albumWhite Pony, this slow-burning ballad is rife with metaphorical imagery and atmospheric musical arrangements.While Chino Moreno’s symbolic lyrics are always freely up for interpretation, there are three common meanings:1.) It is simply about sexual activity in a moving car.2.) He is symbolically talking about willingly putting your life into someone else’s hands, and just being along for the ride.3.) This quote directly from Chino:I did this song with Maynard from Tool. Basically, I told him I wanted to create a scenario of being in a car and being taken for a drive when you don’t really know what’s going on. I wanted him to create a lot of imagery. He wrote a majority of the lyrics and left blanks for me to fill in. It seems like you’re being held captive, but enjoy what’s going on.Passenger is notable for featuring guest vocals byMaynard James Keenan, the front-man ofTool,A Perfect Circle,Puscifer, amongotherthings.On April 7, 2016, Deftones'record labelreleasedThe Studio Album Collection, which is an official remaster of every studio album -not includingB-Sides and Rarities,Covers, andGore.On some songs, there are new elements to be heard that are nonexistent on the original version. In the original mastering stage, there may be some parts the band and producer were wanting to leave out or forgot to put in.After the final line of the song, there is anadditional vocal addedfrom Chino. He has done this live in older shows, but it was not audible in the original record."
Deftones,Sextape,"Frontman Chino Moreno discussed this lament about spiritual isolation with Artist Direct. Said Moreno: “I love that one; it jumps around a lot. I was going to fix it so every verse told one cohesive story, but I decided that I really like it the way it is. It’s really fragmented. Pieces of information are in different places—under the water and in the city. It’s broad, and it feels really good. It adapts to the overall vibe. It has a night time feel to it as well. We’ve been playing it in rehearsal and I realized how much I like it now. When I first wrote it, I thought, ‘You could tell this is one of my songs. It’s probably the most Team Sleep-esque song on the record.’ I didn’t want it to be too self-indulgent right off the bat or for people to think, ‘This is Chino just being Chino.’ Really it’s not; everybody contributes on that song fairly equally. I wrote the opening riff, but the song grew from everybody building on to that. It’s more of a Deftones song than people might believe it is. Playing the song in rehearsal, it sounds mighty. For the simple fact that it doesn’t have any crush guitar, screaming or anything aggressive on it, ‘Sextape’ sounds really big.”"
Hozier,Eat your young,"“Eat Your Young” sees Hozier describe a feast being prepared and served together with the chaos that comes with it. According to the artist, the track is a taste of the9 Circles of Hellmore specifically the 3rd Circle,Gluttony.This is based on the first part ofDante Alighieri’sepic poem known asDivine Comedy.The title could be alluding to the 1729 satirical essay,‘A Modest Proposal’byJonathan Swift,where he suggests, as a solution to poverty in Ireland at the time, that the poor should sell their children to be cannibalised by the rich.The track was first revealed on 24th February 2023 in a post on Hozier’ssocials, together with artwork and tracklist of the EP. This was followed by the firstsnippetof the track with the words;This was followed by the secondsnippetwith a hand doodling drawing and the song playing in the background."
Hozier,From eden,“From Eden” is the title song of Hozier’s second EP.He sayshe wrote it in a tongue-in-cheek way from the point of view of the devil looking at something innocent and seeing it as a missing part. The song tries to woo a woman while admitting that the relationship would be deeply flawed.
Hozier,Nina cried power,"Nina Cried Poweris a classic look on protest songs. The song is a bit of a tribute toNina Simoneand mentions other artists such asMarvin Gaye,John Lennon,B.B. KingandCurtis Mayfield.Hozier sings alongside another popular artist of her timeMavis Staples.When asked about the song Hozier stated;[It’s] a suggestion that the battle for equality these artists championed remains an ongoing and necessary one. “The fights that took place 100 years ago or 200 years ago for whatever — civil rights or workers' right etc. — don’t stop. There is no final victory. [Staples is] the most amazing person, just fucking unbelievable. [Her] energy is still absolutely there.”Source:Rolling StoneOn his Instagram Stories of March 6th 2019, Hozier confirmed the original version of Nina Cried Power was over five minutes and that there was a possibility for release, but that the edited version was the one who made it to the album. The extended version can be heard here:And the lyrics can be consultedhere."
Hozier,Shrike,"“Shrike” is about a relationship that has been lost, and the frustration and sadness that comes with the regret of not appreciating what was had when he had it. The relationship may not have been positive at all times but there was a deep connection that will most definitely be missed. Hozier wishes that in his next life this person will understand that they will not go unappreciated. He will portray his love through the reliance of a shrike on its providing thorn."
Hozier,Someone new,"“Someone new” is the fourth song of Hozier’s self-titled studio album.This song describes how he sees love as a way of distraction from life’s struggles. The song also talks about there’s no right way to fall in love and you can fall in love with someone anytime, in any way."
Hozier,Take me to church,"“Take Me to Church” is the debut single by Irish recording artistHozier. It has become an international hit, reaching #1 in 12 countries, and has been certified five times platinum in the US. “Take Me to Church” wasnominatedfor a Grammy Award for“Song of the Year”in2015.Despite its widespread and international success, Hozier was a struggling musician when he recorded the song. And in fact, it wasn’t until the music video — a critique ofRussia’s anti-LGBT+ policy, which some audiences have found controversial — went viral that the song attracted attention.“‘Take Me to Church’ is essentially about sex,” Hozier said in aninterview withNew York Magazinein March 2014, adding that “it’s not an attack on faith.”It’s about sex and it’s about humanity, and obviously sex and humanity are incredibly tied. Sexuality, and sexual orientation — regardless of orientation — is just natural… The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love.The song has also garnered attention from musicians around the world — it was, for example, covered onThe Voice, and directorDavid LaChapellereleased aninterpretive dance videoof “Take Me To Church”, featuring British Royal Ballet veteranSergei Poluninperforming choreography byJade Hale-Christofi."
Hozier,Too sweet,"In “Too Sweet” Hozier draws a contrast between two individuals with different lifestyles and preferences, one who enjoys living life at his own pace, indulging in simple pleasures like whiskey, coffee, and late nights while not worrying too much about conforming to societal norms of waking up early and living a disciplined life, and a second individual, presumably the partner, is portrayed as someone who values discipline, health, and structure. They encourage the narrator to live a healthier lifestyle, waking up early and taking care of themselves.Born from the 3rd Circle of Hell,Gluttony, same as his track,“Eat Your Young”, Hozier examines excessiveness and overindulgence, similar to Dante’s depiction of gluttony where it not only refers to overconsumption of food and drink but also the overindulgence in any worldly pleasure to the detriment of spiritual growth.The track was first teased on March 6, 2024, during an interview with Chris Black and Jon Stewart for their podcastHow Long Goneepisode614, a second time during the officialannouncementof theUnheard EPand finally on aposton his socials celebrating his first time in Chile for Lollapalooza."
Hozier,Work song,"This is the only song on Hozier’s self titled album to have a title that is not entirely composed of lyrics from the song.The song is about the love of a worker’s life lending him strength during a hard day’s work. The song encompasses indie with strong influences on folk, blues and negro spirituals."
Kasabian,Bless this acid house,"‘Bless This Acid House’ is a song by Kasabian from their 2017 album For Crying Out Loud. Its style has been compared to T-Rex, Stereophonics and Primal Scream."
Kasabian,Club foot,"Accordingto famous Spanish footballer Fernando Torres, the song was used in the Spanish team’s preparation for the 2010 football World Cup in South Africa. The song was played in the dressing room before every match to get the players “in the zone.”Also, as Kasabian are from Leicester andmajor fans of Leicester City FC, the club plays this before every home match along with the Post-Gallop."

Kasabian,Fire,"“It’s like a fight between two bands. You’ve got this trippy voodoo band and then this New York disco band for the chorus. Fire was just trying to combine rock'n'roll with dance music. The way you get that euphoric feeling standing in a field when you know the beat’s gonna kick back in and your whole body rushes, but done in a rock'n'roll way instead of using synths. Nobody’s picked up on it but the ‘Uh-huh’ in Fire is Elvis. In fact, I think Tom’s the first person to have the balls to sing like that since Elvis. The funny thing is when we told our label we wanted it to be the first main single off the album they weren’t sure about it. It ended up being our biggest hit [Number 3, June 2009]. Leicester City have just started using it as their goal celebration music. I was nervous that it’d jinx their chances but the first match we beat Barnsley 1-0.”Serge(Q Magazine, December 2009)"
Kasabian,Goodbye kiss,"The third single from Kasabian’s 2011 album Velociraptor! is a soft ballad, very atypical of their sound, discussing a breakup.It gained particular recognition when it was covered by Lana Del Rey in BBC’s Live Lounge.It is the band’s biggest hit in Italy, peaking at #9 and being certified Platinum."

Lana del rey,Born to die,"“Born to Die” isdescribedbyLana Del Reyas a “homage to true love and a tribute to living life on the wild side.” To quote Chelsea Hodson fromNew York Times, “In [Lana’s] melancholy world, to love is to live, so to love the wrong person is to be “born to die.”It is the opening track from herstudio albumof the same name, released as the second single from the LP.The music video was released on December 14th, 2011, receiving generally positive reviews. She spoke withMTVabout its background:For “Born To Die,” I wrote a treatment for it called “The Lonely Queen,” so that I would be in a setting that represented Heaven, sort of in like a remote castle in Romania. Walking through the halls flanked by tigers. And then she’d be flashing back to happier times in the arms of her love. And then Yoann Lemoine adapted that treatment and made it more doable. But I love that video. I really do. I can’t believe it turned out so beautifully. I spent a lot of time thinking about where I wanted it to go."
Lana del rey,Love,"“Love” sees Lana treading her familiar themes of nostalgia for an idealized American past.She muses on how this generation’s youth maintain a sense of wonder and empowerment in the face of adversity, due in part to the romanticized idea of love driving them forward. This alternative/indie rock track also touches upon the concept of loving others, as well as loving oneself.

Lana del rey,Norman fucking rockwell,"The title track of Lana Del Rey’ssixth studio albumspeaks about an immature, pretentious poet.

Lana del rey,Summertime sadness,"“Summertime Sadness” explores the atmosphere of a bittersweet summertime where Lana danced, cruised and felt electrified with a loved one. This song became a sleeper success from adance remix by Cedric Gervais. The remix entered the Top 50 in the UK, the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it topped the US Dance/Electronic songs chart.The accompanying music videocreated great speculation over its underlying message. It depicts a tragedy where one woman (played by Lana Del Rey) jumps and the other (Jamie King), heartbroken, follows. Due to this, some claim that the song was written for a personal friend of Lana’s that committed suicide, or that it was written for a boyfriend that died years ago. However, there is absolutely no evidence of this, and many believe these speculations to be false in their entirety."
Lana del rey,Video games,"Considered Lana Del Rey’s breakthrough hit, “Video Games” served as the first single off the artist’s wildly successful sophomore studio album and major label debut,Born to Die. The song was notably certified 2x multi-platinum by theRIAAin 2021 — ten years after its release.“Video Games” is a baroque, downtempo pop ballad in which Del Rey, although ignored by her significant other, resolves to love him anyway. The song’s lyrics refer to two broken relationships in the singer’s past. In a statement, the American artist said of the song’s meaning:The verse was about the way things were with one person, and the chorus was the way I wished things had really been with another person, who I thought about for a long time.It’s a song about letting go of my musical ambitions and settling down into a simple life with a person I loved. We had a mutual love for the community of New York, art and hard work.Theaccompanying music videowas directed and edited by Del Rey herself, combining scenes of her performing the song filmed on a webcam with clips of archive footage."

The movie is highly glamorous and exciting; Rick Nowels and I were thrilled to write the song for the film.“Young and Beautiful” was penned by Lana and the film’s director, co-writer, and co-producer Baz Luhrmann, for the soundtrack. Del Rey wrote an earlier version of the song for herParadiseEP,but re-worked itwith Luhrmann after he heard it and decided it’d work great with the movie.

Neither of them were Led Zeppelin era songs.Released in 1979 in as part of the albumIn Through the Out Door, it was their last studio album of new material."
Led zeppelin,Black dog,"“Black Dog,” named after aLabrador dogthat wandered around the studio while Led Zeppelin was recording, sees Robert Plant lamenting about a failed relationship with agold digger.Although the title was inspired by an actual dog, the term “black dog” has been used torefer to negative emotions,as well as aHellhound,a mythical creature that follows someone before they die.The song’s iconic guitar riff was considered hard to play even by Jimmy Page. This may partially be because the riff (written by bassist John Paul Jones) is in the time signature of 9/8, while drummer John Bonham played in 4/4."
Led zeppelin,Dazed and confused,"“Dazed and Confused” is a rework of asongfrom Jimmy Page’s earlier band, Yardbirds, which is in turn a rework of a track byJake Holmes.Holmes eventuallysued Led Zeppelinfor ownership of the song, and the lawsuit wasdismissed.Zeppelin albums then credited Holmes as a writer.The song itself sees the narrator pondering whether or not to leave a toxic relationship.Performanceswould often last longer than twenty minutes, with varying arrangements. It is also one of the few Led Zeppelin songs in which Jimmy Page plays his guitar using a violin bow.The title of this song inspired the title of the cult-classicfilm of the same name,a 1993 movie taking place in 1976."
Led zeppelin,Going to california,"A hauntingly beautiful acoustic tune released on the legendary untitledLed Zeppelin IV, the song tells the story of a man who has left his unkind woman and is off to California with dreams and hopes of finding his real love."
Led zeppelin,Immigrant song,"One of the band’s most iconic releases, “Immigrant Song” likens the band’s trip to Iceland to Norse warriors setting out to colonize America. It’s a short and pumping rocking tune down to the opening riff and barbarian wail.The lyrics, as explained by Robert Plant anddocumented by Wikipedia,are influenced by the band visiting Iceland, aland first settled by Vikings:We weren’t being pompous (about the song)… We did come from the land of the ice and snow. We were guests of the Icelandic Government on a cultural mission. We were invited to play a concert in Reykjavik and the day before we arrived all the civil servants went on strike and the gig was going to be cancelled. The university prepared a concert hall for us and it was phenomenal. The response from the kids was remarkable and we had a great time. ‘Immigrant Song’ was about that trip and it was the opening track on the album that was intended to be incredibly different."
Led zeppelin,Kashmir,"“Kashmir,” one of Led Zeppelin’s signature songs, was written after LZ’s 1973 tour, about a drive through an area ofMorocco.As documented byWikipedia,Robert Plant told music journalistCameron Crowe:The whole inspiration came from the fact that the road went on and on and on. It was a single-track road which neatly cut through the desert. Two miles to the East and West were ridges of sandrock. It basically looked like you were driving down a channel, this dilapidated road, and there was seemingly no end to it.“Kashmir” is both a fan favorite and a live staple that was played at nearly every concert after its release. It features one of the most memorable LZ riffs."
Led zeppelin,Ramble on,"“Ramble On” likens the life journey that the band members were on to find “the one” to the journey taken by Frodo and Sam in theLord of the Ringsfranchise to find and destroy theOne Ring.In both cases, the voyage is taxing — the band must constantly travel the world, playing high-energy shows along the way, while the One Ring can become all-consuming to anyone who carries it. However, in both cases, they must continue on their journey, or “ramble on.”"
Led zeppelin,Stairway to heaven,"“Stairway to Heaven” is one of Led Zeppelin’s most famous recordings,with many considering it the greatest rock song of all time.It tells the story of a greedy woman who is overly optimistic about her unpromising future.The song resonated with young listeners, opening up a door to a different realm of spirituality and transporting them into a more mystical view of life. The vagueness of the lyrics also allows listeners to interpret the song in their own way, adding to the magic and mystery of the track."
Led zeppelin,Thank you,"“Thank You” is a ballad off Led Zeppelin’s second album, Led Zeppelin II. It features John Paul Jones on organ and has lyrics completely written by Robert Plant. It’s a tribute to his then-wife Maureen.“To me it was kind of almost uncharacteristic of other stuff off that album. It sounds like a 60s pop song to me – the way that they have it arranged. And it’s almost like that would’ve been, with any other band, would’ve been their biggest hit, but because it was Led Zeppelin and the album was so unbelievable and it was their [second] album, [the other songs within the album] almost kind of passed over it” – Chris Cornell on The Howard Stern Show in 2011."
Led zeppelin,Whole lotta love,"“Whole Lotta Love” is Led Zeppelin’s most sexually explicit song — “love” can be replaced by both “sex” and “penis” in different sections. The track  was largely inspired by Willie Dixon’s blues track“You Need Love,”recorded byMuddy Waters.A1972 lawsuitsaw Dixon sue the band for copyright infringement, and Dixon was later credited.Acoverof the song by Collective Consciousness Society was used as the theme song of BBC TV’sTop of the Pops, a music program that aired from 1964 to 2006."

I’m hoping I learn to perform it with more composure but for now it’s very much a work in progress."

Noah kahan,No complaints,"Noah appears to address the struggles that can happen when you attempt to address mental health and related issues. Sometimes, things aren’t as bad as they were before, but you still feel numb and disconnected and it can be difficult to recognize that you can still complain because you aren’t where you may want to be."
Noah kahan,Orange juice,"It seems Noah is reflecting upon a loved one who got into a traumatic drunk driving accident that was fatal for some passengers. They had left home (New England) and upon coming back, they are struggling with being in the place where everything happened. They can’t comprehend how life could have gone on there afterwards when their own life and identity had been so irrevocably altered by the event. Noah is gently welcoming them back home, telling them there is (the titular) orange juice in the kitchen, so they won’t be driven to the alcohol that so affected them. He provides them an alternative and tries to compassionately drive them towards self-forgiveness."
Noah kahan,Stick season,"“Stick Season,” Kahan’s first single from the album of the same name, commemorates a familiar time in his home of Vermont, when the trees are bare and winter threatens. It’s an unsettling time when the narrator reflects on life and the way it could have been."

Sam fender,Dead boys,"“On average, 84 men take their own lives in the UK every week.”The song is about how (British) society ignores or chooses to ignore male suicides, perhaps due to social stigma and a taboo to discuss suicidal thoughts by men specifically.Research has shown there to be more men who commit suicide than women, though research suggests that more women experience suicidal thoughts.Sam Fender said the following in aninterview with NME:It’s a song about male suicide, particularly in my hometown, I lost some friends very close to me because of that. This song came from that place, and I have been playing it to other people ever since. It’s raised a conversation and I realised how much of a present issue it is. Everybody that I spoke to from all different parts of the country have all got a connection to someone they’ve lost.“It really opened my eyes to how much of an issue it is. If it gets to one person and they feel like they should reach out and talk to somebody, then it has done a good job.”Sam also discusses the song and its suicidal backstory at length with LADbible:"
Sam fender,Howdon aldi death queue,"Howdon Aldi Death Queue is the B-side to single ‘Seventeen Going Under’, released July 2021. The rapid-fire, punk-infused track came about after Fender saw a group of old people queuing for a local Aldi supermarket during the coronavirus pandemic.Sam tells theNME: “I wrote it in about 30 seconds. Normally, I write my lyrics first but this time I just kinda mouthed the melody and then the lyrics came soon after""“The take that you hear is the first take we hit,” he recalled. “That’s the vocal in one take as well. There was no click. It was completely free and live. And it sounds so fucking huge.”“My whole plan was to do a whole punk band side project on the sly that nobody would know about,” he revealed. “I’d do it like the Gorillaz, where nobody knows who it is, and call the band Howdon Aldi Death Queue. I still might do it.”"
Sam fender,Hypersonic missiles,"Building upon this Brit Award winning artist’s theme of ‘starting again’ with society, toxic masculinity and  the possibility of redemption, Sam Fender released “Hypersonic Missiles” in March 2019.Running throughout the song are some of Fender’s most present vocals, coupled with his signature soaring guitar riffs that hint at the anthems of 80’s British rock.Themes present are the acceptance of the state of Fender’s world; one that has increasingly descended into a quiet chaos; threats of war, global warming and political nightmares; Fender understands he takes part in the global witnessing of this decline, but knows that truthfully he would rather turn away.However, midway through the song, Fender reveals that this lyrical confession is actually directed towards a figure—most likely ourselves as we listen, but possibly a romantic interest. It’s plausible this monologue mirrors Fender’s desire to build something beautiful with this figure, and admitting to the problem that surrounds them means they can start to repair the damage, hopefully together. It’s a metaphor for relationships (something Fender has already called out in a previous track), the state the world has left them, and the solution to building one that is strong, bright and brilliant."
Sam fender,Play god,"“Set in an alternate dystopian reality that shares similarities with our own world,” Sam Fender’s “Play God” revolves around theideaof anOrwellianoverlord who controls society and generates mistreatment of the working class.The track was originally released on 31 March 2017 as Fender’s official debut single and was later included as part of thesoundtrackfor FIFA 19 in September 2018.

The negative effects of greedy politicians have haunted the North East for years, it’s very apparent. I’m not an expert on politics, but there’s a bunch of bad people at the top who care about lining their own pockets before creating a society that looks after the vulnerable."""

It’s based around my own relationship with my old man, and how we both struggle as blokes to communicate the way we feel to each other without it becoming a stand off. It’s about how the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, as I get further in to my twenties I see so much of myself in him, especially when it comes to being stubborn. The second half of the song talks about seeing him with my grandma when she passed away, and how I saw him as a son, and how that moment reminded me to make the most of my time with him. If anything, it is a declaration of love for him.”"

The lumineers,Angela,"In the reddit feedback in response of who’s angela they said: “Angela is not a person, more of an idea – in slow it down it’s sort of a breakup song with NYC, and in Angela it’s the central character of the story – some of the songs are about real people and some are stories and metaphors”"

The lumineers,Ho hey,"Ranked at #36 in United StatesWesley Schultz is trying to do the right things the right way, whether it’s in a relationship or in life in general. Although he does say, “it”, which might means he’s trying to do what he’s going through right.Even though he’s trying to do the right things, his life is lonely. He’s not happy…there is something missing causing him to feel lonliness even though he’s trying to do right, which should bring happiness.He doesn’t know what he did and when that started the chain of events in action? He doesn’t know why she left him? He doesn’t know how he got so lonely and lost even without her since he’s been trying to do all the right things. Or maybe he thought doing all the right things would bring her back somehow.He’s not able to tell her these things or they’re not communicating this or she’s not seeing what all he’s doing. A song is a romantic way to tell someone you miss them, or maybe the song is to make himself feel better.if she would have went to where he was he’d be standing by someone else that wasn’t her, and how would she have felt or what would she have thought? Would that be right? And he’s talking about what it would have been … past tense, was there someone else back then and now he wants her back and she’s moving on and he doesn’t think she’s right for any other guy but him?The bleeding means life, and seeing his family will bring him back to life, but his life is feeling like it’s fading and he doesn’t want to lose everything he’s been trying to do right while waiting on her. So, obviously, this is a love note in form of a song so he could say it the way he felt it."
The lumineers,Ophelia,"“Ophelia” is“the cornerstone”ofThe Lumineers’s sophomore album,Cleopatra.  It was the first track written and recorded for the album, following which band member Jeremiah Fraites said he “felt like it was easier to proceed finishing the album.”The song is also about how the band has dealt with the success it has achieved since it’s 2012 self-titled debut. Singer Wesley Schultz told EW:”Ophelia“ is a vague reference to people falling in love with fame. That spotlight can seem like an endless buffet, but in reality, you’re just shiny, bright, and new to people for a quick moment—and then you have the rest of your life to live."
The lumineers,Salt and the sea,"“Salt and the Sea” is a song by American folk rock band The Lumineers for their third studio album III.

It is also part of ‘'The Ballad of Cleopatra’‘, a short film released by the band that brings together five different music videos. This song talks about the travelling of the narrator and another woman, who sounds like is escaping a hometown.

The lumineers,Slow it down,One of the slowest songs on the album and likely one of the most powerful ones.It depicts a relationship where the two partners grow apart due to the female’s lust for glamour.
The lumineers,Stubborn love,"Stubborn Love is the second single from The Lumineers' self-titled debut. It was released on October 3rd, 2012.

The rolling stones,Beast of burden,"The 1978 hit (reached #8 in the US charts), considered by many one of the top 20 Stones' songs. AKeith Richards/Mick Jaggercreation, that like many other of the Rolling Stones songs started with a Keith Richards idea and a riff, and Jagger completes the song.From the albumSome Girlsthat yielded the #1 hit“Miss You”and was the first oneRonnie Woodas a full member of the band."
The rolling stones,Brown sugar,"Recorded in 1969 in Muscle Shoals studios, Jagger wrote the riff to this one while filmingNed Kellyin Australia. The song appeared onSticky Fingersand is a staple of the Stones' canon.Keith Richards, in his bookLifeon Jagger’s lyrics writing process:They started running down Brown Sugar the first night, but they didn’t get a take. I watched Mick write the lyrics. It took him maybe forty-five minutes; it was disgusting. He wrote it down as fast as he could move his hand. I’d never seen anything like it. He had one of those yellow legal pads, and he’d write a verse a page, just write a verse and then turn the page, and when he had three pages filled, they started to cut it. It was amazing!""The song is thought to have been inspired by soul singerClaudia Lennear, who was also the inspiration behind David Bowie’s“Lady Grinning Soul”.There are several different ways to interpret this song. The most straightforward is a meditation on white male on black female sex  and how power has influenced it. Alternatively it could be more generally about interracial sex or black sex. Finally, as meta-fiction: Mick Jagger plunders the musical history of black people from slave rhythms, to spirituals, to blues, to honky tonk. And further is willing to proudly crow about how tempting and good they are.The first reading is probably what was intended, but given the rollicking rock, the final is not inappropriate whether intended or not."
The rolling stones,Gimme shelter,"“Gimme Shelter” is the opening track of the Rolling Stones’s 1969 albumLet It Bleed(where it was actually spelled “Gimmie Shelter”, but the more accurate spelling was adopted afterwards).It paints a bleak world view inspired by the Vietnam war, as put byMick Jagger:“Well, it’s a very rough, very violent era. The Vietnam War. Violence on the screens, pillage and burning. And Vietnam was not war as we knew it in the conventional sense. The thing about Vietnam was that it wasn’t like World War II, and it wasn’t like Korea, and it wasn’t like the Gulf War. It was a real nasty war, and people didn’t like it. People objected, and people didn’t want to fight it…” As for the song itself, he concluded, “That’s a kind of end-of-the-world song, really. It’s apocalypse; the whole record’s like that.”However, the song’s inspiration was not Vietnam or social unrest, but Keith Richards seeing people scurrying for shelter from a sudden London rainstorm.“I had been sitting by the window of my friend Robert Fraser’s apartment on Mount Street in London with an acoustic guitar when suddenly the sky went completely black and an incredible monsoon came down. It was just people running about looking for shelter — that was the germ of the idea. We went further into it until it became, you know, rape and murder are ‘just a shot away’.”The female vocals were sung by session singer Merry Clayton. Jagger explained in the 2003 bookAccording To… The Rolling Stones:The use of the female voice was producer Jimmy Miller’s idea. It would be one of those moments along the lines of ‘I hear a girl on this track – get one on the phone.’ Clayton, pregnant at the time, reportedly suffered a miscarriage soon after the session.On the 1969, 1972 and 1975 U.S. tours as a straight ahead hard rock song without female accompaniment, it didn’t return to the setlist until 1989 when Clayton’s vocal turn usually went toLisa Fischer. The 50th anniversary tour had some special appearances byLady Gaga(New Jersey),Florence Welch(London) andMary J. Blige(also London).Grace Potteralso had the honors in 2015.U.S. President Barack ObamatoldRolling Stonein an interview while campaigning for his first term that the Stones were one of his musical heroes (along withStevie Wonder) and “Gimme Shelter” was his favourite Stones song.Gimme Shelter* is also the title to the Maysles brothers' 1970 documentary film of the Stones' 1969 U.S. tour climaxing with the infamous Altamont concert near San Francisco."
The rolling stones,Miss you,"“Miss You” was released in 1978 as a single from the Some Girls album and peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.  Penned by Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, this hit has been covered by the  great Etta James on her Matriarch of Blues album, Musiq Soulchild on his 2003 Soulstar album, Anthony Hamilton and several other artists."
The rolling stones,Sympathy for the devil,"This song is sung in first person form, with Mick Jagger playing no one else but Satan himself. He documents events through history that could be seen as “works of the devil.”The Rolling Stonestook some serious heat for singing a song from the devil’s perspective, but the point of the song is more about the flaws in mankind. It was never intended as devil worship.There was a rumor that this song was playing when a fan died at the Rolling Stones gig at theAltamont Free Concert, but it was actually “Under My Thumb.” Despite that, the Stones didn’t perform this song for at least 5 years (as they played it on tour in 1975) after the incident.These lyrics were inspired by the book“The Master and Margarita”written by Mikhail Bulgakov. In this book Devil (and his ‘gang’) roam around Moscow in the 1930s and play tricks on stupid/greedy people."
The rolling stones,Wild horses,"Originally,Keith wrote “Wild Horses” as a simple lullabyfor his son, finding it more and more difficult to part from Marlon to go on tour.The song then took on a different complexion under Mick’s pen. [Marianne Faithfull has revealed thatWild horses couldn’t drag me awaywere the first words she uttered to Mick in the hospital when she came out of a six-day coma caused by an overdose of sleeping pills in the summer of 1969. For the Stones frontman, however, “Wild Horses”has nothing to do with Marianne Faithfull.From the liner notes to the 1993 Stones' anthology,Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones:Everyone always says it was written about Marianne, but I don’t think it was; that was all well over by then. But I was definitely very inside this piece emotionally. This is very personal, evocative, and sad. It all sounds rather doomy now, but it was quite a heavy time.The Stones recording ""Wild Horses"" at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios"
The stone roses,Bye bye badman,"“Bye Bye Badman” centers upon riots in Paris, May 1968. The lemon slice on the album cover is also inspired by these riots, which focused upon  the philosophy of situationalism, additionally the protests attempted to suppress the allegedly overbearing establishment of the period. During  the riots, lemons were used to counteract the tear gas used by riot police. Brown  and Squire noted this and wrote the song in recognition of the bravery and togetherness of the protesters in the face of violence."
The stone roses,Fools gold,“Fools Gold” is a one-of-a-kind song that became the Stone Roses' biggest commercial hit at the time. It was their first single to reach the UK Top Ten.
The stone roses,I am the resurrection,"“I Am the Resurrection” is the classic conclusion to the Stone Roses'debut album. It contemplates how false religion is through a human relationship, finishing with a four minute instrumental outro.QMagazine voted it the 10th best guitar track ever.The song’s religious title also leads nicely into the band’s second album –Second Coming.The song was released as the seventh and last single off ofThe Stone Roses."
The stone roses,I wanna be adored,"A lucid album opener spearheaded by the hushed ringing vocal of Ian Brown, repeating selected lines of lyrics throughout the entire song.The song is a mea culpa to fans of the band who criticized the band for signing to a major label, with Ian Brown effectively claiming that the group did so in order to reach a wider audience via the resources of his new label."
The stone roses,Love spreads,"This is the last song on their album,Second Coming. It challenges the traditional view of Jesus by describing a black woman as Jesus, being crucified."
The stone roses,Made of stone,"“Made Of Stone” is a starkly brooding and enigmatic element of the eponymous album and captures the roses at their most mysterious. In terms of the narrative, the song allegedly reflects the events of Jackson Pollocks car crash, this can be supported through Squire’s imitation of Pollock’s style on the singles artwork while Brown’s lyricism such as ‘your knuckles whiten on the wheel’ have strong implications towards the car crash and Pollock’s subsequent death.It was released as the second single off ofThe Stone Roses."
The stone roses,Sally cinnamon,"“Sally Cinnamon” was the second single from The Stone Roses, released in May 1987. Two mixes were released – a 7"" single mix at 2:55 (included onThe Complete Stone Roses), and a very different 12"" mix at 3:28 (included onThe Very Best of the Stone Roses).The Stone Roses were never lyrically ambitious, but often spun gold from lyrical simplicity as with this lightweight but gorgeous track, a personal love story of people known only from a note."
The stone roses,She bangs the drums,“She Bangs The Drums” was released as the third single off ofThe Stone Roses.
The stone roses,This is the one,"This song is played ahead of every Manchester United home game in Old Trafford, Ian Brown being a lifelong United supporter."
The stone roses,Waterfall,"“Waterfall” was released as the sixth single from The Stone Roses' seminal self-titled debut album.The following track,“Don’t Stop”, is a reversed version of “Waterfall” with new lyrics.Listening to each song reversedsuggests that the lyrics to “Don’t Stop” were written to sound like the lyrics to “Waterfall” backwards – consequently, if you play “Don’t Stop” backwards, the lyrics sound like “Waterfall” forwards."
The strokes,Barely legal,"One of three tracks originally included onThe Modern AgeEP that prompted a record label bidding war and would later appear on their debut albumIs This It.“Barely Legal” is about a girl who’s just turned 18 and is extremely naive in everything she does. The narrator is talking about her and how he doesn’t see anything in her but is obsessed with her still for some reason.Interestingly enough, Julian’s father John Casablancas infamously had an affair with a 16 year old modelwhen he was 41. The irony of the situation could be a jab at his father who he was known to have issues with or a mere coincidence."
The strokes,Is this it,"This opening track to The Strokes' 2001 debut ended up arbitrarily spawning the album’s title.When we were trying to find titles for the record it could’ve been called“Take It Or Leave It”or any of them, but I thought it sounded cool in more ways than one. It’s deep without being pretentious. –Julian Casablancas"
The strokes,Last nite,"One of three tracks originally included onThe Modern AgeEPthat prompted a record label bidding war and would later become the second single off ofIs This It.In March 2005, Q placed “Last Nite” at number 66 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In September 2006, NME placed it at number one on its list of the 50 Greatest Tracks of the Decade. In May 2007, NME magazine placed it at number nine in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. It was also placed at number 16 on Rolling Stone’s 50 Best Songs of the Decade and number 478 on its list of “The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time”. In 2011, NME placed it at number 4 on its list “150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years”."
The strokes,Ode to the mets,"On “Ode to the Mets,” the final song onThe New Abnormal, Julian looks back at the band’s career and history in New York City, where they grew up together.Bleak, quiet guitars and synthesizers back the track’s verses, while full, strong instrumentation comes in for the track’s outro, leaving the listener with an epic outro onThe New Abnormal.Additionally, the song begins with the same chords during the chorus (this time on the synthesizer) as previously heard on the album’s opening track, “Adults Are Talking”. Thus serving as the beginning and end of the “journey”.InEpisode 2of the band’s podcast/video chat, “5guys talking about things they know nothing about,” the band discusses this track. TheNew York Metsare a Major League Baseball National League team based In Queens, New York and have not won a World Series since 1986. Julian calls the Mets the team of his youth. Julian wrote the song while waiting on a subway platform, after the Mets had lost a painful National League Wild Card game in 2016 against the San Francisco Giants. Julian wanted to remove the Mets from the song title, naming it “Ode,” only to be talked out of it by Fabrizio Moretti and the band who love the song title. The band views the name as symbolic, with the Mets representing something that you set your heart to that continues to disappoint you.The track wasdebutedat their New Years' Eve 2019 Show at the Barclays Center in New York, NY, connecting the song even further to New York."
The strokes,Reptilia,"The title “Reptilia” refers to the “reptilian brain”, the central part of your brain that handles basic emotions such as love and hate."
The strokes,Selfless,"“Selfless” is centered around love and relationships, with Julian beckoning to a significant other that he wants them to come live life with him, not missing out on a moment that they do not have to.He cites this person as his motivation for continuing on in life, a dependency that, once broken, may be the cause of the apparent relationship strife Julian seeslateronin the record.The track features a string-centric instrumentation with heavy guitar and bass, with tinging cymbals filling the background of the instrumental."
The strokes,Someday,“Someday” was the third single fromIs This It. It peaked at #17 on the U.S. Alternative Songs chart and at #27 on the U.K. Singles Chart.
The strokes,The adults are talking,"“The Adults Are Talking” is the opening track onThe New Abnormal. The track takes on a rebellious tone against higher-ups in the world, a common theme in The Strokes' discography, with Julian singing about people in the business world lying, wanting to “climb into the walls” of those who don’t like the group and their attitudes.The track features a mostly bass-centric instrumental with very peppy snares drums providing the main percussion on the track. Julian sings in a more muffled tone than usual on the track as well, almost emulating that he is sneaking up on those he wants to rebel against, elevating his vocal volume over the track’s progression.The band premiered the song on the first night of their “global comeback” tour during their first show at the Wiltern in Los Angeles, CA, on Monday, May 13, 2019. The music video, directed by Roman Copolla was released on December 1, 2020."
The strokes,The modern age,“The Modern Age” was one of three tracks included onThe Modern AgeEPthat prompted a record label bidding war and later appeared on their debut studio albumIs This It.The track is an observation of life’s idiosyncrasies in “modern” times. It stomps like a renegade elephant with bashed kickdrums and turbulent guitar riffs while Casablancas passionately reels off in an unsteady sing-speak that invokes all the right elements of a great rock leadman.
